# accelerated-cpp

This repository contains my journey through **_Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example_** by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. It includes all book examples, my exercise solutions, notes, and simple test harnesses to help reinforce each concept.

- **`chapters/`**  
  - One folder per chapter.  
  - `examples/`: verbatim code snippets from the book (with attribution).  
  - `exercises/`: my own solutions, clearly named (e.g. `ex1_2.cpp`).

- **`docs/`**  
  - Markdown notes, key takeaways, common pitfalls, miniâ€“cheat sheets.  
  - Optional UML or ASCII diagrams to visualize concepts.

- **`tests/`**  
  - Simple unit tests (using your preferred framework) to verify exercise correctness.

- **`scripts/`**  
  - Helper scripts:  
    - `build.sh` â€“ compile all chapters' code with one command.  
    - CI config (GitHub Actions workflows, if you want to autoâ€“build on push).
