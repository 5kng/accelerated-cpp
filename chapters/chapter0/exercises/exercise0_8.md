0-8. …and this one?

#include <iostream>
int main() {
// This is a comment that extends over several lines
// by using // at the beginning of each line…
    std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl; return 0;
}

Valid. Each // only comments to end-of-line. The std::cout and return are real statements (even if on one line), and the braces make a proper function body.
