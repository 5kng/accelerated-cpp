## 1-0 Compile, execute, and test the programs in this chapter.

All of the example programs in Chapter 1 compile without errors or warnings and run to produce the behaviors described in the text:

The “Hello, world!” program writes its greeting.

The framed-greeting program reads your name and prints a box around “Hello, <name>!”.

The string-concatenation examples, scope examples, and input-reading examples all behave as illustrated.
